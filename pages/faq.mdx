## Why Dubhe?

Dubhe is the first technology stack based on the Move language developed to address complex fully onchain application scenarios such as fully onchain games and fully onchain world/universe type applications.

## Why Move?

Move is a programming language for writing secure smart contracts, originally developed by Facebook to power the Diem blockchain. Move aims to be a platform-agnostic language to enable common libraries, tools, and developer communities across different blockchains with very different data and execution models. Move aims to be the ubiquitous “JavaScript for the Web3” - developers should write in Move when they want to quickly write secure code that involves assets.

In the on-chain environment, decentralization and security are the first elements, and we hope that the infrastructure network built based on the Move language will further promote large-scale adoption by developers to improve user experience.

## What is the Dubhe roadmap?

Dubhe is rapidly evolving. You can find open issues on the Dubhe Github and join the Discord to get involved. If you have ideas for the project, please open an issue.

## Can I deploy Dubhe on any Move networks?
Yes! Dubhe can run on any Move-VM including the public blockchains. Through Dubhe's development of a generic ORM in the Move Network Structured Storage Schemas type, you can quickly develop a generic Move decentralized application.

## Who maintains Dubhe?
Dubhe is an open-source initiative, licensed under Apache 2.0, dedicated to promoting and advancing the concept of Dubhe Engine. It is developement is led by Obelisk Labs, with significant contributions from many more contributors.
