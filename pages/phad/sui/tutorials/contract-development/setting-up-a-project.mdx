## Sample Dubhe project
A simple project creation wizard will ask you some questions. After that, the wizard will create some directories and files and install the necessary dependencies.

The initialized project has the following structure:

```bash
contracts
dubhe.config.ts
package.json
tsconfig.json
```
These are the default paths for a Dubhe project.
- contracts/: This directory contains the contracts of the project.
- dubhe.config.ts: This file contains the configuration of dubhe.

## Setting up your editor
```bash
cd dubhe-template-project && pnpm install
code .
```
