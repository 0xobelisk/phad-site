# Dubhe CLI for Aptos

Before getting started with Dubhe CLI, please install the required dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install -D @0xobelisk/aptos-cli @0xobelisk/aptos-common
```

> Note: @0xobelisk/aptos-common contains essential configuration type definitions like DubheConfig.

## The Dubhe CLI

The Dubhe CLI is a development toolkit for building and managing Dubhe projects on the Aptos blockchain.

Core features:

1. [`schemagen`](#schemagen): Generate Dubhe schemas automatically from your store schemas configuration
2. [`publish`](#publish): Deploy your Dubhe projects to any Aptos network (mainnet/testnet/devnet/localnet)
3. [`upgrade`](#upgrade): Upgrade your Dubhe Move contracts
4. [`localnode`](#localnode): Manage local Aptos node for development
5. [`faucet`](#faucet): Interface with Aptos faucets to fund addresses on testnet/devnet/localnet
6. [`test`](#test): Run tests for Dubhe contracts

## Installation

The CLI should be installed as a project dependency rather than globally. When you create a new project using `pnpm create dubhe`, the CLI is automatically added as a dev dependency.

## Using the CLI

Some commands expect a dubhe config in the same folder where the CLI is being executed. This includes `schemagen`, `publish` and `upgrade`.

`faucet` and `localnode` can be executed anywhere.

## Commands

### `schemagen`

Generate Store libraries from a `dubhe.config.ts` file. See the [Store Config and `schemagen` documentation](../schemas/config) in the Store section for more details.

```bash
dubhe schemagen [--config-path <path>]

Options:
  --config-path    Path to config file (default: "dubhe.config.ts")
```

### `publish`

Deploy Dubhe contracts to Aptos network. This tool will use the `dubhe.config.ts` to detect all systems and schemas to deploy them to the specified network.

Before deploying the contract, please ensure:

1. You have sufficient tokens in your account for deployment fees
2. For testnet/devnet/localnet deployments, you can get test tokens via `dubhe faucet`
3. For localnet deployments, ensure your local node is running

```bash
dubhe publish --network <network> [--config-path <path>] [--named-addresses <addresses>]

Options:
  --network           Target network (mainnet/testnet/devnet/local/movementtestnet/movementdevnet/movementlocal)
  --config-path       Config file path (default: "dubhe.config.ts")
  --named-addresses   Named addresses in format "name1=address1,name2=address2"
```

### `upgrade`

Upgrade deployed Dubhe contracts.

```bash
dubhe upgrade --network <network> [--config-path <path>]

Options:
  --network        Target network (mainnet/testnet/devnet/local/movementtestnet/movementdevnet/movementlocal)
  --config-path    Path to config file (default: "dubhe.config.ts")
```

### `localnode`

Manage local Aptos node.

```bash
dubhe localnode <action> [options]

Actions:
  start     Start local node
  stop      Stop local node
  status    Check node status
  restart   Restart local node

Options:
  --background, -b       Run node in background mode
  --force-restart, -f    Clean state and start new chain at genesis
```

Local RPC endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:9000`

Note: Make sure your local node is running properly before using other commands that require a local node (e.g., `publish --network local`).

### `faucet`

Request test tokens from the Aptos faucet. The default faucet service automatically gives test tokens to accounts in `.env`.

```bash
dubhe faucet --network <network> [--recipient <address>] [--amount <number>]

Options:
  --network     Network to request tokens on (testnet/devnet/local/movementtestnet/movementdevnet/movementlocal)
  --recipient   Optional recipient address (uses PRIVATE_KEY env if not specified)
  --amount      Amount of tokens to request (default: 50000000)
```

### `test`

Run tests for Dubhe contracts.

```bash
dubhe test [--config-path <path>]

Options:
  --config-path    Path to config file (default: "dubhe.config.ts")
```

## Environment Setup

Some commands require environment variables to be set:

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Required for deployment and some other operations
- Can be set up using a `.env` file in your project root

When using the deployer, you must set the private key of the deployer using the `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable. You can make this easier by using [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) before running commands.

## Network Support

The CLI supports the following networks:

- Mainnet
- Testnet
- Devnet
- Local
- Movement Testnet
- Movement Devnet
- Movement Local

For testnet/devnet/localnet operations, you can get test tokens using the `faucet` command.
